    "Use the following prompts to complete this challenge.\n",
    "1.\tThe following code creates four pandas DataFrames from the one DataFrame `person_df`. The `person_df` DataFrame has two columns - `Height` and `Weight` â€“ and 100 million rows. The DataFrame `person_df` is filled up randomly, and using the function `np.random.normal()` the code makes sure that the random values are generated within the reasonable range that we would expect for the values of weight and height. The chosen units of measurement for weight and height are Kilograms and Centimeters. After the generation of `person_df` is completed the four DataFrames are created from `persond_df`, and they are kept in the dictionary `dfs`. The difference between these DataFrames is their data type; these DataFrames have data types of *int8*, *int16*, *int32*, and *int64*, respectively. Run the code, and go to the next step. Pay attention the code might take a few seconds to complete.\n"
