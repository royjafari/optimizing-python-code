    "1. The code snippet below defines a function `system()`, which simulates a system whose optimum performance we aim to find. This function helps illustrate the concept of Gradient Descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import time\n",
    "def system(x):\n",
    "    time.sleep(0.1)\n",
    "    return 2*x**2 - 100*x + 15000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `time.sleep(0.1)` call in the function simulates the delay that might occur in a real-world system, such as waiting for a response from a sensor or processing a complex calculation. This addition helps to create a more realistic scenario where each function evaluation takes time, similar to what might happen in practical applications. This function models a quadratic equation, allowing us to practice finding the minimum value using Gradient Descent."

    "\n",
    "Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to find the minimum or maximum value of a function. Hereâ€™s how it works, step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize**: Start with a random point on the function. This point is often chosen randomly or based on some heuristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculate the Gradient**: Compute the slope (or gradient) of the function at the current point. The gradient indicates the direction of the steepest ascent (or descent).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update the Point**: Move the point in the opposite direction of the gradient. The amount you move is controlled by a parameter called the learning rate. This step ensures you move towards the minimum value of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Repeat**: Repeat the process of calculating the gradient and updating the point until the change in the function value between iterations is very small (or for a set number of iterations). This indicates that you have reached the minimum value (or are very close to it).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Convergence**: The algorithm converges when the updates to the point are very small, indicating that the minimum value has been reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Gradient Descent works by iteratively moving towards the minimum value of a function by following the direction of the steepest descent, as indicated by the gradient."
