    "#### Example of Sliding Window pattern\n",
    "In this example, we would like to come up with a function that calculates the moving averages of a given time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving average is a forecasting method that uses the average of the last K values of the time series as the forecast for the next value in the time series. If K = 1, then then the last value of the series will be the forecast value. If K=2, then the mean of the last two values will be the forecast value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following two functions will get a K and a series and output the moving averages. The name of these functions are `moving_average_brute_force()`, and `moving_average_sliding_window()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code shows the definition of `moving_average_brute_force()`.\n",

    "    result = []\n",
    "    n= len(series)\n",
    "    for i in range(n-K+1):\n",
    "        result.append(sum(series[i:i+K])/K)\n",
    "    return(result)\n",
    "```\n",

    "The following code shows the definition of `moving_average_sliding_window()`.\n",

    "    result=[]\n",
    "    n = len(series)\n",
    "    _sum = sum(series[:K])\n",
    "    result.append(_sum/K)\n",
    "    for i in range(n-K):\n",
    "        _sum -=series[i]\n",
    "        _sum +=series[i+K]\n",
    "        result.append(_sum/K)\n",
    "    return (result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `moving_average_brute_force()` gets the CPU to go over all the n-K+1 subsets of the series. Also, on each iteration, the CPU must go over the K values in the subsets to add them and calculate the mean. All in all, the CPU must perform something (n-K+1)*K times, and after simplification, the CPU usage that the function will have can be shown by O(n*K).\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, during the function `moving_average_sliding_window()` the CPU will have to similarly go over the n-1+K subsets, on each iteration it only needs to remove the first value from the subset and add a new value to the subset. All in all, the CPU must perform smoothing (n-K+1)*2 times; when simplified the computational complexity of this function can be represented by O(n). \n",
    "\n",
    "The sliding window is the name of a coding strategy in that the code that will keep a window of data across its processing, and by sliding it will get the task done. In this example, you experienced how using this codding pattern we were able to decrease the computational complexity from O(n*K) to only O(n). For instance, when I use my computer to calculate the moving averages with K=100 for a series with a million values, it takes `moving_average_brute_force()` 2.6 seconds while it takes `moving_average_sliding_window()` only 420 milliseconds.\n"

    "#### Two Pointers Coding Pattern\n",
    "When we come up with a programming solution using a loop, we normally assume under each loop we can keep track of only one index, or pointer. That assumption is not true, and the two-pointers coding pattern is the antithesis of the assumption. By learning this codding pattern you will be able to put that assumption aside when it is advantageous.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, let us discuss the function `find_doubles_brute()` that we came up with in his chapter under Understanding Big O Notation, Learning the common Big O Complexities, Example of decreasing computational complexity at the expense of memory complexity. The function’s definition is the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def find_doubles_brute(num_list,val):\n",
    "    output = []\n",
    "    n = len(num_list)\n",
    "    for i in range(n):\n",

    " ```\n",
    "The function takes in the list of sorted numbers `num_list` and another number val, and finds the pairs of number from `num_list` that sums up to `val`. Because the function is written under the assumption that under each loop we can only keep track of one index, the function had to use two loops to get the task done, and because of the two loops, the computational complexity of the function is O(n2). \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the function `find_doubles_two_pointers()` disrupts that assumption and uses two pointers in one loop to get the task done. The following is the definition of said function.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def find_doubles_two_pointers(num_list,val):\n",
    "    output = [] \n",
    "    p1,p2 = 0, len(num_list)-1\n",
    "    while p1!=p2:\n",
    "        _sum_val = num_list[p1] + num_list[p2]\n",

    "    \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `find_doubles_two_pointers()` keeps track of the two pointers, `p1`, and `p2`, in one loop. Before the loop begins, the first pointer `p1` points to the beginning of `num_list`, and the second pointer `p2` points to the end of `num_list`. During the loop, If the sum of the value that the two pointers point to, which is `_sum_val`, is smaller than val, `p1` moves forward one index; if `_sum_val` is larger than `val`, `p2` moves backward one index; if `_sum_val` is equal to `val`, the pair that `p1`, and `p2` points to are appended to the output. When `p1` and `p2` point to the same index, the loop terminates and output is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the two pointers codding pattern the function `find_doubles_two_pointers()` is capable of solving the programming task only in one loop and that improves the computational complexity to O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a side note, the function `find_doubles_two_pointers()` is better than `find_triplets_hashtable()` as well; we came up with this function in this chapter under Understanding Big O Notation, Learning the common Big O Complexities, Example of decreasing computational complexity at the expense of memory complexity. While both functions’ computational complexities are O(n), the function `find_doubles_two_pointers()` is advantageous in terms of memory complexity as it does not use any extra space; the function `find_triplets_hashtable()` has to use O(n) extra space due to the hash table.
